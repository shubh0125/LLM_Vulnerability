      "2. **Code structure**: The code is organized into distinct sections (e.g., finding the owner, initializing the pi_state), which makes it relatively easy to follow.\n",
      "3. **Error handling**: The function has a reasonable number of error checks and returns (`-EINVAL`, `-ESRCH`, `-EAGAIN`), indicating that the author has considered potential issues and provided clear responses.\n",
      "4. **Code repetition**: There are no obvious repetitive patterns or duplicated code, which suggests that the author has kept the code concise.\n",

      "\n",
      "* The code is relatively short and concise, with only a few lines of code. This suggests that it is not overly complex or bloated.\n",
      "* The code uses standard C syntax and does not appear to contain any excessive or unnecessary complexity.\n",
      "* However, the code still has some dependencies on other functions (e.g., `do_no_restart_syscall`) and data structures (e.g., `ktime_t`), which could potentially make it more difficult to understand or maintain if they are not well-documented or if their implementation is complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I would rate this code as having a moderate level of complexity, making it somewhat vulnerable to maintenance and scalability issues. However, it does not appear to be extremely fragile or prone to catastrophic failures. With proper documentation and testing, this code could likely be maintained and scaled reasonably well.\n",

      " **Complexity = 4**\n",
      "\n",
      "The codebase is moderately complex. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Functionality**: The function implements a complex algorithm to manage futexes (Fast Userspace Mutex) and their associated states. It involves searching for existing futex states, updating reference counts, and allocating new states when necessary.\n",
      "2. **Data structures**: The code uses several data structures, including `struct futex_pi_state`, `struct futex_q`, `struct plist_head`, and `union futex_key`. These structures have their own complexities, such as maintaining linked lists (`list` and `pi_state_list`) and reference counts (`refcount`).\n",
      "3. **Conditional logic**: The code has multiple conditional statements (e.g., `if (match_futex(...))`, `if (!pid)`, `if (p->flags & PF_EXITING)`), which can increase the complexity of the function.\n",
      "4. **Concurrency**: The code uses spinlocks (`raw_spin_lock_irq` and `raw_spin_unlock_irq`) to protect access to shared data structures, introducing concurrency-related complexities.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the code is not extremely complex (rating 1) because:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Modular design**: The function is divided into logical sections, each with a specific purpose (e.g., searching for existing futex states, allocating new states). This modularity makes the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
      "2. **Simple data structures**: While there are multiple data structures involved, they are relatively simple and easy to comprehend.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Code length**: The function has approximately 150 lines of code, which is considered long for a single function.\n",

This complexity makes it challenging to understand the code without a deep dive into its functionality.\n",
