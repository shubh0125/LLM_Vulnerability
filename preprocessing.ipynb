      "* The code is relatively compact, with only 40 lines of code. This suggests that it's well-organized and easy to follow.\n",
      "* However, the function has several nested if statements and conditional checks, which can make it harder to read and maintain. This may lead to a higher risk of errors or bugs being introduced as the codebase evolves.\n",

This could slow down the learning curve for new developers who are unfamiliar with the codebase.\n",

      "1. The function `instance_mkdir` is complex and has many conditional statements and error handling paths. This suggests that the function might be responsible for a significant portion of the overall logic in the codebase.\n",

      "The codebase is considered to be moderately vulnerable to maintainability and scalability issues. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The function has a moderate number of variables (around 10-12), which can make it challenging to understand and maintain.\n",

      "* The function has a relatively small scope of functionality (removing an instance of ftrace trace array), which makes it easier to understand and maintain.\n",

      "* Complexity of the code: The function has a moderate level of complexity, with multiple loops and conditional statements. However, it does not contain extremely complex logic or deeply nested structures.\n",
