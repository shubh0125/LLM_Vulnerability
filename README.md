# CommitInformation.py

### Functions

- **get_commit_details(owner, repo, commit_hash, token):**
  Fetches detailed information about a specific commit using the commit hash.

- **get_tree(owner, repo, tree_sha, token):**
  Retrieves the tree structure of a specific commit, including all files and directories recursively.

- **get_file_content(owner, repo, file_sha, token):**
  Retrieves the raw content of a specific file based on its SHA.

- **find_file_in_tree(tree, file_path):**
  Locates a file in the tree structure by its path and returns the file's SHA.

- **view_file_in_commit(owner, repo, commit_hash, file_path, token):**
  Displays the content of a specific file at a given commit.

- **get_previous_commit(owner, repo, commit_hash, token):**
  Identifies the parent commit of a given commit, useful for navigating commit history.

- **get_file_information(owner, repo, commit_sha, file_path, token):**
  Fetches information about a file in a specific commit, with retry logic to handle API rate limits.

- **get_file_information_without_token(owner, repo, commit_sha, file_path):**
  Similar to the above but without the need for an API token, included for testing purposes.

# JsonFunctions.py

### Functions

- **open_json_file(file_name):**
  Opens a JSON file and returns its contents as a Python dictionary.

- **create_json_file_format_1(file_name, limit):**
  Creates a JSON file with a specific format, containing a series of versions up to the specified limit, and saves it to disk.

- **create_json_file_format_2(file_name, limit):**
  Similar to `create_json_file_format_1`, creates a JSON file with the same format and saves it to disk. The functionality appears identical to `create_json_file_format_1`.

# ParseCPPToExtractFunctions

### Functions

- **read_cpp_file(file_path):**
  Opens and reads the content of a C++ file. If the file is not found or an I/O error occurs, it returns an appropriate error message.

- **find_function_content(content, function_name):**
  Searches for and extracts the complete content of a specified function from the given C++ code. This method works by:
  
  1. **Finding the Function Declaration:**
     - Uses a regex pattern to find the function declaration, including its name and parameters. The pattern looks for the function name followed by parentheses containing parameters and an opening brace `{`.
  
  2. **Identifying the Function Body:**
     - Initializes counters for open and close braces to track the start and end of the function body.
     - Iterates through the content from the start of the function declaration, incrementing the `open_braces` counter at each opening brace `{` and the `close_braces` counter at each closing brace `}`.
     - Determines the start position of the function body at the first opening brace `{` and the end position when the count of open braces matches the count of close braces.
  
  3. **Extracting and Returning the Function:**
     - Combines the function name, parameters, and body to form the complete function.
     - Returns the complete function as a string. If the function is not found or the end of the function cannot be determined, it returns `None`.
